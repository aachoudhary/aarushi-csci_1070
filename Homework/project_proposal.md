Are you working alone or with someone else? If working with someone please put their name.
What is your plan for working on this? How much time do you plan to dedicate to working on your project? If working with a partner, how will you coordinate to work on the project?


I will be working alone. I plan to dedicate around 10-15 hours (2-3 hours a day)

What dataset are you going to use (you can select more or less anything not already used in class or homework)? 

I will be using the Titanic Dataset

What is your starting hypothesis about the data? Create a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis as follows:
Null: For the Titanic dataset there will be no difference between embark location and survival rate.
Alternative: For the Titanic Dataset, there will be a difference between embark location and survival rate.

What models do you plan to apply to your data first? 

I first want to preprocess the data, either through one hot encoding or cleaning up the columns. Then I hope to use linear regression, maybe KNN.
