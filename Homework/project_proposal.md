Are you working alone or with someone else? If working with someone please put their name.
What is your plan for working on this? How much time do you plan to dedicate to working on your project? If working with a partner, how will you coordinate to work on the project?

I will be working alone.  I plan to dedicate around 10-15 hours (2-3 hours a day).

What dataset are you going to use (you can select more or less anything not already used in class or homework)? 

Netflix Movies Titles. The Netflix Titles dataset includes information about movies and TV shows on Netflix. It covers details like title type, director, cast, production country, release year, rating, duration, genres, and a short description of each movie. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahulvyasm/netflix-movies-and-tv-shows/data 

What is your starting hypothesis about the data? Create a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis as follows:
Null: There will be no significance between release year and rating
Alternative: There will be a correlation between release year and rating. 

What models do you plan to apply to your data first? 

Decision Trees, K-Means, maybe do some sampling to it.
